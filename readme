every controller have extends framewrok class and has a model
you can use framework class and the mode in view that deal within the controller

example
controller

class home extends Framework{

  public function __construct(){
    $this->auth = $this->model('auth');
  }

  public function index(){

    $data = [];
    return $this->view('main_page/home', $data);
  }

}

thats mean you can use
  1 - auth model in home view with out include the model
  2 - framework class you can use all method in home view from him without include the class
